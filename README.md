# SQLCovidProject
In this project I downloaded a kaggle dataset of updated Covid 19 infection and death statistics and ran several queries to find rates in countries around the world. When downloaded, the file was a .csv so after I got rid of some of the data I wasn't interested in Excel I saved the file as a Excel Worksheet and imported the file into SQL Server. After I completed all the queries I needed, I ran each one individually and copied the results into a excel file to upload into Tableau to create a visualization. The visualization results can be seen at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ashtin4783/viz/CovidDashboard_16431362562810/Dashboard1.
